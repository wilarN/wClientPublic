Just a public copy of the wClient that won't be getting updates.
#### Realized this version was missing some very much needed components for it to work. But it is what it is, so see if you can figure it out by yourself and keep in mind this version is just for refrence and not for use. So basically useless. But it's here if someone ends up finding it u-s-e-f-u-l after all.
